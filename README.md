- Hi, I'm Yuqing Zhou. You can also call me Susan. I am wroking towards a BSc in Computer Science at McGill University, and my expected graduation time is 2026. 
- I’m interested in data science, web development, and computer science in general! I have been programming in python and java for more than 2 years. I have some knowledge of SQL and databases as well. 
- I’m currently enrolled in Udemy's "Python for Data Science and Machine Learning Bootcamp" on top of my several Computer Science and Mathematics classes at McGill University. I am also learning HTML, CSS, and Javascript by myself! 
- At this moment, my main goal is to land my first intership next summer, but I am open to anything, so don't hesitate to contact me! 
- My email address: zhouyuqing2023@outlook.com
