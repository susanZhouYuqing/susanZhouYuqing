- Hi, I'm Yuqing Zhou. You can also call me Susan. I am working towards a BSc in Computer Science at McGill University, and my expected graduation time is 2026.
- I’m interested in data science, web development, and computer science in general. I have been programming in python and java for more than 2 years, and I'm fairly familiar with the most common python data science libraries such as numpy, pandas, matplotlib, etc. I also code in javascript, and I know html and css fairly well. I have some knowledge of SQL and databases too. 
- At this moment, my main goal is to land my first intership next summer, but I am open to anything, so don't hesitate to contact me! 
- My email address: zhouyuqing2023@outlook.com
